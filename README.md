# Conventional Scripts

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to address the existing gap in the JavaScript ecosystem by establishing a streamlined naming scheme for "scripts" in "package.json" files. Introducing the "[Conventional Scripts](https://conventionalscripts.org/)" specification, we aim to define a set of widely accepted script names through collaboration with the community and popular projects. Our goal is to foster consistency and standardization in script naming conventions. We invite you to join our mission by actively engaging in discussions on GitHub and making valuable contributions through pull requests. Together, let's create a stronger and more cohesive JavaScript ecosystem.
